# Freedom-Debt-Campaign-Analysis

This project is based on a real-world take-home assignment for data science roles at Freedom Debt Relief.

The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a $5 million marketing campaign aimed at promoting Freedom’s debt relief program, using five months of client and deposit data. The campaign was executed during Month 3, with the goal of demonstrating success to the marketing, sales, and operations teams.

Using three datasets — client data, deposit behavior, and calendar references — the project focuses on:

Providing a quantitative assessment of the campaign’s success by defining and calculating appropriate success metrics.

Offering recommendations for improving future campaign strategies based on observed results.

Estimating how campaign performance might have differed if it had been postponed to a later month (Month 6), providing an incremental comparison.

Clearly presenting insights through data visualization, structured analysis, and business-driven conclusions.

The project highlights the complete data science workflow — including data preparation, metric design, critical thinking, and actionable business recommendations — with a strong emphasis on storytelling through data.
